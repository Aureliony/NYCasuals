# The Competition
In CoSpace Rescue Challenge, teams have to develop and program appropriate strategies for autonomous robots to navigate through the competition environmentto collect objects.

# Project Layout
## Main Program
Contains the C++ code for the robot.

## External Scripts
Contains a few helper scripts for converting the original bmp to an integer array representing the map (generate mapData.hpp).

# Setup
1. Download CoSpaceRobot Simulator (https://cospacerobot.org/download/cospace-rescue-download)
2. Download g++ Compiler Toolchain for Windows 32bit (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/dwarf/)
3. Collect Map data, use helper scripts to generate mapData.hpp
4. Copy mapData.hpp to Main Program folder 
5. Make a few more changes to the program based on the map
6. Run Build.bat

# Disclaimer
The code was written under heavy time constraints during the competition and thus does not follow common coding standards and best practices.
